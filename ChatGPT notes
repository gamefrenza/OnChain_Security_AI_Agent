### **Guidance for Building an Onchain Security Monitoring AI Agent**

An AI agent that monitors onchain security risks can proactively identify vulnerabilities, flag suspicious transactions, and enhance the security of blockchain ecosystems. Below is a step-by-step guide to building such a system:

---

### **1. Core Features of the Security AI Agent**
1. **Threat Detection**  
   - Monitor onchain activities for suspicious patterns (e.g., flash loan attacks, rug pulls, large token transfers).
   - Use anomaly detection algorithms to flag unusual behavior.  
2. **Smart Contract Vulnerability Analysis**  
   - Analyze deployed smart contracts for common vulnerabilities like reentrancy, integer overflow, and unchecked calls.  
3. **Risk Scoring**  
   - Assign risk scores to addresses, transactions, or contracts based on predefined metrics (e.g., frequency of interactions, token flow anomalies).
4. **Real-Time Alerts**  
   - Notify users or projects about risks via onchain messages or offchain notifications (e.g., email, Discord, Telegram).
5. **Onchain Forensics**  
   - Trace fund movements in potential exploit cases to track stolen assets.  
6. **Decentralized Security Governance**  
   - Allow community participation in refining the AI's detection models via a DAO.

---

### **2. High-Level Architecture**
#### **Frontend**
- **Framework:** Use React (or React Native for mobile).  
- **Features:**  
  - Dashboard to display flagged risks, risk scores, and transaction details.  
  - Wallet integration for users to monitor specific addresses or contracts.

#### **Backend**
- **Node.js + TypeScript**  
  - Fetch and process blockchain data.  
  - Host APIs to expose security insights to the frontend.  
- **GraphQL APIs:** Use tools like **The Graph** to fetch real-time blockchain events.

#### **Blockchain Interaction**
- **Libraries:** Ethers.js or web3.js to interact with the blockchain.  
- **Smart Contracts:** Deploy a contract for onchain alerts and DAO-based governance.

#### **AI Model**
- **Algorithms:**  
  - Supervised learning for detecting known threats.  
  - Unsupervised learning (e.g., clustering) for detecting anomalies.  
- **Tech Stack:** Use Python with TensorFlow or PyTorch.  
- **Data Sources:**  
  - Onchain data (e.g., transaction history, smart contract state).  
  - Offchain feeds (e.g., Chainlink for additional threat intelligence).

#### **Database**
- **Storage for Analysis:** Use MongoDB or PostgreSQL for historical transaction data.  
- **Decentralized Options:** Store critical risk data on IPFS or Arweave for immutability.

#### **Security-Oriented Analytics**
- **Onchain Behavior Patterns:** Analyze token flow, transaction frequency, and contract interaction sequences.  
- **Historical Data Analysis:** Compare current behaviors with historical patterns to detect anomalies.

---

### **3. Development Workflow**

#### **Step 1: Data Collection**  
- **Setup an Ethereum node (e.g., Infura, Alchemy, or self-hosted Geth) to access onchain data.**  
- Use GraphQL or JSON-RPC APIs to fetch:  
  - Recent blocks and transactions.  
  - Contract creation events and interactions.  
  - Token transfer logs (e.g., ERC-20 or ERC-721).  

#### **Step 2: AI Model Development**  
1. **Data Preprocessing:**  
   - Extract relevant features like transaction size, token type, gas usage, and timestamps.  
   - Normalize and encode data for AI algorithms.  

2. **Algorithm Selection:**  
   - **Anomaly Detection:** Isolation Forest or DBSCAN to detect unusual transactions.  
   - **Classification Models:** Random Forest or XGBoost for predicting malicious activity.  

3. **Training the Model:**  
   - Train models on historical exploit datasets (e.g., MEV exploits, reentrancy attacks).  
   - Use labeled datasets from blockchain security repositories (e.g., Ethernaut challenges).  

4. **Testing and Deployment:**  
   - Test the model on live data streams from testnets (e.g., Goerli or Sepolia).  
   - Deploy models using TensorFlow Serving or PyTorch Serve.  

---

#### **Step 3: Smart Contract Deployment**
- **Purpose:** Enable onchain logging of security alerts or risk scores.  
- **Contract Features:**  
  - Function to log flagged transactions.  
  - Role-based access control for submitting AI-detected alerts.  

Example:  
```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract SecurityAlerts {
    struct Alert {
        address reporter;
        string message;
        uint256 timestamp;
    }

    Alert[] public alerts;

    function logAlert(string memory _message) public {
        alerts.push(Alert(msg.sender, _message, block.timestamp));
    }

    function getAlerts() public view returns (Alert[] memory) {
        return alerts;
    }
}
```

---

#### **Step 4: Frontend Development**
1. **Dashboard Features:**  
   - Display flagged transactions with details (e.g., transaction hash, risk score).  
   - Interactive graphs for historical trends.  

2. **React Components:**  
   - `TransactionList`: Displays flagged transactions.  
   - `RiskChart`: Visualizes risk scores over time.  

3. **Wallet Integration:**  
   - Use `ethers.js` to connect wallets and fetch user-specific risks.  

---

#### **Step 5: Notifications and Governance**
1. **Notifications:**  
   - Integrate offchain alerts using Twilio, Telegram bots, or Discord webhooks.  
2. **Governance:**  
   - Deploy a DAO contract where users vote to adjust the AI agent's behavior or add/remove flagged risks.

---

### **4. Enhancements**
1. **Multi-Chain Support:** Extend to monitor multiple chains (e.g., BNB Chain, Polygon).  
2. **AI Model Refinement:** Use federated learning to incorporate community feedback into the AI.  
3. **Tokenization:** Launch a native token to incentivize users for reporting and validating risks.
